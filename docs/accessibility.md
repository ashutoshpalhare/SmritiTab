# Accessibility and UX QA

## Phase 4 changes

- Keep the generated dashboard bundle untouched; refinements are loaded as separate stylesheets.
- Keyboard focus uses the existing orange product accent, with a clear 3px outline and offset.
- Windows High Contrast / forced-colors mode receives a system-color focus outline and non-glass widget borders.
- The existing generated dashboard stylesheet already supports `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`; the widget overrides also remove hover transitions.
- The Weather → Clock → Quote widget strip stays in one row. On narrow screens it becomes horizontally scrollable with touch momentum, visible orange scrollbar thumb and snap points. Very narrow screens receive narrower card tracks instead of a forced vertical stack.

## Phase 4 exit status

**Phase 4 implementation: COMPLETE.** The keyboard-focus, forced-colors and responsive widget-strip refinements are committed, and automated regression coverage passes. Real Chrome/assistive-technology checks are explicitly carried into Phase 5 release QA; they are not represented as already executed.

## Manual verification checklist

Run these checks in Chrome with the extension loaded from both the repository root and `dist/`:

1. Use Tab and Shift+Tab from the New Tab page. Every interactive control should show a clearly visible orange focus outline.
2. Activate buttons, links, switches and dialogs using Enter or Space where appropriate.
3. Verify focus remains visible on search inputs, bookmark controls, dock items, widget actions and modal close controls.
4. Enable Windows High Contrast / forced-colors mode and confirm focused controls and widget boundaries remain visible.
5. Enable the operating system's reduced-motion preference and confirm dashboard transitions/animations are minimized.
6. Repeat in light and dark themes and at 320px, 375px, 640px and desktop widths. Confirm the widget strip remains one horizontal row and can be scrolled without clipping the rest of the page.
7. Confirm existing settings, bookmarks, notes, tasks and favorites remain unchanged after updating the extension.

## Scope and limitations

Automated checks verify stylesheet loading and the presence of the accessibility/responsive contracts. They do not prove every runtime control is keyboard-operable or that all text/background combinations meet WCAG contrast thresholds. Those require real-browser and assistive-technology checks. The manual matrix remains a release smoke-test responsibility; no unexecuted Chrome test is represented as passed.
